This userEXT is for you to add new configs or modify existing ones. This folder will not be overwritten by new myExt updates.

Add the new configs in the root. Modules copied from Core and Extra or made by you in /MODULES folder to keep the same variables amongst modules. Makes it easier to modify and test.

New and good configs, ask rasat to add them to extra or core. Contact in Arch Linux or MX Linux forums.
