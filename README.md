# myEXT
This model is designed for Fvwm3 but also works on Fvwm2 with minor differences. The startup script changes ~/.fvwm/config to local.config for Fvwm3 usage.

FVWM myExt is a collection of ready-made Fvwm configs inspired by the Gnome Extensions and other plugins that makes a DE/WM multifunctional. This gave the name "FVWM myExtensions" (myEXT). Started as an experiment and became a fully functional base that makes daily computer workflow simpler and more efficient.

It is a user-oriented model for you to use, modify and create your own extensions. They are placed in the ~/.fvwm folder divided into three main folders (core, extra, and user) and system files that run in the same sequence as the original Fvwm config. The additional extensions are simply added in associated folders. One graphical Extension Installer is included making it user-friendly for those who prefer a quick setup of their choice.

* coreEXT  (coreEXT.sys)	- essential myExt configs.
* extraEXT (extraEXT.sys)  - additional configs.
* userEXT  (userEXT.sys)   - user configs, does changes to core and extra config settings.
