# myEXT
FVWM3 myExt default setting of core and extra extensions for public download. A collection of ready-made Fvwm configs inspired by the Gnome Extensions that made Gnome multifunctional. This gave the name "FVWM myExtensions". Started as an experiment and became a fully functional base that makes "my" daily computer workflow simpler and more efficient.

This is a user-oriented model for you to use, modify or create your own extensions. The default FVWM config is the base, directly in ~/.fvwm folder. The extensions are divided into three main folders (core, extra, and user) and system files that run in the same sequence as the original Fvwm config. The additional extensions are simply added in associated folders. A graphical Extension Installer is also included making it user-friendly for those who prefer a quick setup of extensions of their choice.

coreEXT  (coreEXT.sys)	- essential myExt configs.
extraEXT (extraEXT.sys) - additional configs.
userEXT  (userEXT.sys)  - user configs, does changes to core and extra config settings.
